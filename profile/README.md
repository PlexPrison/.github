Plex Prison is a Mineplex Game, where players must mine their way to freedom, or attempt an escape. The goal is to
escape as fast as possible, and be the richest player.

This Github Organization is dedicated to our open source projects, to help the Mineplex Studios development community
with any resources we think would be of public good. We publish everything under
the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit).
